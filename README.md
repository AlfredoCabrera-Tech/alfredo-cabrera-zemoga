# Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test (Alfredo Cabrera)

This is my submission for the candidate test. 

### Technologies used

- ReactJS
- Styled Components
- localStorage
- Volta

### To run this code

- Clone this repository 
  using Git clone or downloading the zip file containing the source code from GitHub
- Unzip the file if necessary
- Access the folder through any terminal/shell
- Run the command "npm install" ans wait for the modules to download/install on your machine
- Once the previous step was finished, run the command "npm start" from the root directory of said folder (The browser will open automatically with the website)

### Notes

In order to ensure the website runs correctly anywhere, both the node and the npm versions were locked using Volta as per Zemoga's suggestion, so any machine with Volta installed, could access the same node and npm versions the website was created with.
